## Getting started for custom levels

### Installation procedure

0. Make sure you have the [**latest version of JumpKingPlus**](https://github.com/JumpKingPlus/JumpKingPlus/releases/latest) installed.
1. Download the [**sample level**]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshop/1/) from the workshop.
2. Drag the `mods` folder from the zip file to `Jump King/Content` folder. If you already have a `mods` folder existing, proceed to rename or delete the folder.
3. You now have a custom level ready to work on!

After installing and downloading all the files and tools needed; you can start working on your first custom level.

> In order to make the custom level working you will need to create two files inside your `JumpKing/Contents/mods` folder. JumpKingPlus loads the custom mode when both the `level.xnb` and the `mod.xml` files are in the folder above.

<u>Using the sample level, you don't have to worry about creating this</u>, but you will need to worry to understand the format and the meaning of those two files.

### Testing

Testing is the most important phase of your level that should take you a lot of time, a good level has every single fall calculated, nothing is left to be random. Check out some more on [**tips page**]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshop/publish/).

To test your sample level **for the first time** you just need to:
1. Boot up Jump King.
2. Click on the greeen "Sample Level" text.
3. Your sample level will now boot!

Next up, for testing the following times, you'll just boot up the game and click *Continue*.
