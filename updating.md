        <p class="mt-2 mb-0">Make sure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are in the right Steam account.</li>
            <li>You have uploaded at least an item and are subscribed to it (therefore finished downloading).</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
   </blockquote>

   <blockquote class="highlight">
    <details>
        <summary>If you don't see your item from the dropdown, expand this.</summary>
        <p>If you have just uploaded it, consider restarting the tool once the item has been downloaded from Steam. Otherwise make sure you are subscribed your item and it is downloaded.</p>
    </details>
   </blockquote>

4. Make sure the **"Updating from" folder** of your item is correct in directory.<br>This folder will be what you will update so make sure your item's content is right.
   ![Step 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/updating/Step4.png)

5. *Optional*{: .text-grey-dk-000 }

   **Add a new thumbnail or replace the existing one**

   To add or replace the thumbnail, click on the **"Replace thumbnail"** button and select the image you want to use.

   {: .warning }
   > For the Steam limitations, we recommend you to follow the following details:
   - resolution: **256x256 pixels**
   - file size: below **34 kB** (kilobytes)
   - bit depth: **8 bit** *(not required but lowers the file size dramatically)*
   - image type: **png** *(not requred but lowers the file size dramatically)*

   If the image follows the limitations above, it will prompt you a message telling you it has changed the thumbnail to the image selected. *(Don't forget to click Update to change it!)*
   ![Step 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/updating/Step5.png)

6. Add a changelog to let other players know what you've changed in this version.<br>
   ![Step 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/updating/Step6.png)

7. Click Update and let the tool update the item for you.
   ![Step 7]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/updating/Step7.png)

## Reverting changes

Once completed, you can navigate on your item's page thanks to the completion prompt and by clicking on the "Change Notes" tab page you can make sure you have updated your item.

![Step 7a]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/updating/Step7a.png)

{: .warning }
> This only works if you change the contents of the item, if you change the thumbnail, you won't see any change note.

The changelog text comes very handy when you plan to have multiple versions of your work. This way you can easily identify each version and revert back if you need to!
