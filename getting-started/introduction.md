## Custom levels
### Disclaimer
When it comes to Custom levels, folders that this document refer to are meant to be inside `Jump King/Content/mods`. 

### Common rules
Level design in Jump King is a delicate balance between fairness and hardness. These rules are not only made to prevent unfair and impossible levels but to respect Nexile's original ideas on level design. In order to get your map approved on the site, these rules **need** to be followed.

## Reskins/collections
### Disclaimer
If you are working on a Jump King Base reskin, enabling and disabling it will work only in the title screen (currently) and they won't be working on custom maps since it would overlay the already existing base for the custom map.

### Common rules
Rules on reskins/collections are a bit more "leanient" than custom levels since it doesn't have such a big impact.

{% include rules/reskins.html %}

### Reskin or collection?
Before getting started you need to know the difference between a reskin and a collection.

- A **reskin** is a *single custom skin* that can be toggled singularly in the `Reskins` menu.
- A **collection** is a *group of skins* that can be toggled together in the `Collections` menu.
