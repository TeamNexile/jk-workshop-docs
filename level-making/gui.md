    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <LocationSettings xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
        <locations>

            <Location>
                <start>1</start>
                <end>1</end>
                <unlock>1</unlock>
                <name>YOUR_LOCATION_NAME</name>
            </Location>

        </locations>
    </LocationSettings>
    ```
    > **If this is not the first time**, paste the following snippet below the closing tag of the latest location.
    ```xml
        <Location>
            <start>1</start>
            <end>1</end>
            <unlock>1</unlock>
            <name>YOUR_LOCATION_NAME</name>
        </Location>
    ```
4. Replace the `start` value with the first screen of your location.
5. Replace the `unlock` value with the screen that you want to trigger the location title to show up.
    > If you don't  want the location title to show up, simply put `0` as a value.
    {: .highlight }

6. Replace the `end` value with the last screen of your location.
7. Replace `YOUR_LOCATION_NAME` with the name of your new location.

> Since this is supposed to be a linear location grouping method, if you trigger a later present location, the middle locations won't be triggered.
{: .disclaimer }

> Make sure your location always ends before starting another one! This can cause problems later on if ignored.
{: .warning }

### Removing a location

To remove a location:

1. Find what is the name of the location you are looking to remove.
