## Raven
is the entity related to the bird.

It is located inside the `textures/raven` folder. The folder should contain:
- the raven texture `(raven name).xnb`
- the configuration file `(raven name).ravset` (which is an xml file named ravset).

> Ravens are also hardcoded in the game. Please use the ones already available.

The following file shows an example of a raven.
