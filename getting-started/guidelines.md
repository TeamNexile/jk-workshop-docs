## Nexile's guidelines

Just like JumpKingPlus had some *rules*, the Nexile gave some **guidelines**. That means you don't have to strictly follow the rules to get your item published.

### Skin and sets 

As of now, Nexile's focus is on the polished levels so the guidelines for skins are very slim.

{% include rules/reskins.md %}

### Polished levels

Level design in Jump King is a delicate balance between fairness and hardness. These guidelines are not only made to prevent unfair and impossible levels but to respect Nexile's original ideas on level design. <u>Nexile won't endorse polished levels that won't follow their guidelines.</u>
