## Why does Jump King need a configuration file?

In order for get the basic data about your map, Jump King (and in the past with JumpKingPlus) uses a configuration file.

This configuration file contains your level: 
- **title** (that will show up in the pause menu)
- **babe screen number** (where the first babe will spawn)
- **second babe screen number** (where the second babe will spawn)
- **third babe screen number** (where the third babe will spawn)
- **starting position** (changing your initial position and speed)
- **ending images** (for each babe)
- **ending extra images** (letting you choose what item can trigger the secondary ending image)
- **end credits** (once you finish your level, after the cutscene)

## Steps (without Worldsmith)

### Setting your level title

1. Search for "title" in your XML file.
   You should find something like this:
   ```xml
   <title>YOUR_TITLE_HERE</title>
   ```
2. Replace `YOUR_TITLE_HERE` with your title name.
3. Done!

### Setting a different babe screen number

1. Search for "ending_screen" in your XML file.
   You should find something like this:
   ```xml
   <ending_screen>YOUR_ENDING_SCREEN_HERE</ending_screen>
   ```
2. Replace `YOUR_ENDING_SCREEN_HERE` with your babe screen number.
3. Done!

For the second and third babe, the procedure is the same but replacing your search query with "ending_screen_second" or "ending_screen_third".

### Setting the starting data

To set a new starting data:
1. Copy the following snippet: 
    ```xml
    <StartData>
        <Position>
            <X>YOUR_X_POSITION_HERE</X>
            <Y>YOUR_Y_POSITION_HERE</Y>
        </Position>
        <Velocity>
            <X>YOUR_X_VELOCITY_HERE</X>
            <Y>YOUR_Y_VELOCITY_HERE</Y>
        </Velocity>
    </StartData>
    ```
    > If you want don't want a custom position or a custom velocity, you can decide to remove the entire tag you don't want **but** make sure you always have the X and Y value of the tag you left in since those are necessary.
    {: .disclaimer }

2. For the <u>position</u>, replace your `X` and `Y` with the **absolute value** that you can find while testing the level. For the <u>velocity</u>, replace your `X` and `Y` at your will.
   > The velocity can be voided if the user is standing on a solid block by default.
   {: .warning }
3. Done!

To remove a starting data, select the **whole** `StartData` tag and delete it.

### Setting the ending images

1. Make sure you have a packed image (file that has been converted to XNB) with **480x360 pixels of resolution**.
2. Move your image into the `ending` folder.
3. Search for "MainBabe" in your XML file.
   You should find something like this:
   ```xml
   <MainBabe>YOUR_ENDING_IMAGE_HERE</MainBabe>
   ```
4. Replace `YOUR_ENDING_IMAGE_HERE` with your ending image name.
5. Done!

For the other babes, repeat the process replacing your search query with "SecondBabe" or "ThirdBabe".

### Setting the ending extra images

1. Make sure you have a packed image (file that has been converted to XNB) with **480x360 pixels of resolution**.
2. Move your image into the `ending` folder.
3. Search for "MainItem" in your XML file.
   You should find something like this:
   ```xml
   <MainItem>
    <item>Shoes</item>
    <image>YOUR_ENDING_IMAGE_WITH_ITEM_HERE</image>
   </MainItem>
   ```
4. Replace `Shoes` with the item of your choice based on the [item list]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/items){: target="_blank"}.
5. Replace `YOUR_ENDING_IMAGE_WITH_ITEM_HERE` with your ending image name.
6. Done!

### Setting the end credits

1. Search for "EndingLines" in your XML file.
   You should find something like this:
   ```xml
   <EndingLines>
    <Credit>
        <header>YOUR_FIRST_ENDING_TITLE_HERE</header>
        <people>
            <string>YOUR_FIRST_ENDING_FIRST_ITEM_HERE</string>
            <string>YOUR_FIRST_ENDING_SECOND_ITEM_HERE</string>
        </people>
    </Credit>
    <Credit>
        <header>YOUR_SECOND_ENDING_TITLE_HERE</header>
        <people>
            <string>YOUR_SECOND_ENDING_FIRST_ITEM_HERE</string>
            <string>YOUR_SECOND_ENDING_SECOND_ITEM_HERE</string>
            <string>YOUR_SECOND_ENDING_THIRD_ITEM_HERE</string>
            <string>YOUR_SECOND_ENDING_FOURTH_ITEM_HERE</string>
            <string>YOUR_SECOND_ENDING_FIFTH_ITEM_HERE</string>
        </people>
    </Credit>
   </EndingLines>
   ```

> One instance of Credit equals one credit that's being shown, while there isn't a strict limit of this, having more than 5-6 `Credit` tags can be hard to follow.
{: .disclaimer }

2. Replace `YOUR_FIRST_ENDING_TITLE_HERE` with your first credit main title.
3. Replace all the `YOUR_FIRST_ENDING_[...]_ITEM_HERE` with whatever subtitles you want to add.<br>You can add or remove the `string` tags that you dont need.
    > Having more than 5 `string` tags can cause some of them to overflow the screen making them invisible.
    {: .disclaimer }

4. Done, you've set your first credit!

To add a new Credit simply add another Credit like the example above.
