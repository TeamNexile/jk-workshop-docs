## Copyrighted audios

> If a copyright holder of a song/asset asks us to remove the copyrighted material due to not having a proper license for usage, your item will be removed from the Workshop for copyright infringement. Only by replacing the copyrighted material or by acquiring the proper license/permission for its usage, the item can be reuploaded on the Workshop. If the user is found reuplading copyrighted content, it is *subject* to a Workshop ban.
{: .warning }

## File size

> Music and ambience sounds tend to be the most heavy files in Jump King. Make sure you compress your music/audio enough so the **level** once compressed **doesn't have file size that's too large**! It's recommended that you try to keep the final **mods** folder below **1GB**. The average map size is around **750-800 MB**.
{: .warning }

## Ambience or music?

All ambience can be all background sounds (bonfire, birds, rain or wind sounds) that can complete the immersion of the player. Meanwhile [music is already what you already know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90I3pWDfbxU){:target="_blank"}

To differentiate music from ambience, Jump King uses a special tag called `AmbienceInfo` that you will need to create. You can still add ambience pieces in the `AmbienceInfo` tag if you want to use the restart, fade-in or fade-out option but it will need to have its own `type` value to differentiate.

### Adding music or ambience (without Worldsmith)

1. Convert your audio file into a packed XNB file [making sure it isn't too big](#file-size) (usually a song shouldn't go over 45-50 MB).
2. Place your packed file in `audio/background`.
3. Navigate into the `data` folder and open the `values.xml` file.
4. **If you are adding a generic ambience (doesn't need fade-in/out), you can [skip to the next steps](#adding-to-level)**.
5. Copy the following snippet:
   ```xml
   <AmbienceInfo>
    <name>YOUR_AUDIO_FILENAME</name>
    <type>Music</type>
   </AmbienceInfo>
   ```
6. In a new line after the opening tag of `special_info`, paste the snippet.
7. Replace `YOUR_AUDIO_FILENAME` with the filename of the audio file.
8. Being a song, you should leave the `type` as **Music**, otherwise use **Ambience**. [**API Reference**]({{site.baseurl}}/api/music){: target="_blank"}.
   
    > If you want the audio to stop and play from the start again once returned to the screens where it is added, add the following snippet below your `type` tag:
      ```xml
        <restart>true</restart>
      ```
    {: .highlight }
    > If you want to have fade in and/or fade out effect add the following snippet(s) below your `type` tag and replace `YOUR_FADE_OUT_SECONDS` and `YOUR_FADE_IN_SECONDS` with your customized values (4 seconds is usually recommended).
      ```xml
        <fade_out_length>YOUR_FADE_OUT_SECONDS</fade_out_length>
        <fade_in_length>YOUR_FADE_IN_SECONDS</fade_in_length>
      ```
    {: .highlight }

Good, you've set the properties for Jump King to understand that you added a Music piece, now let's add it on the first screen.
{: #adding-to-level }

1. Copy the following snippet:
   ```xml
    <AmbienceSave>
      <ambience>
        <Ambience>
          <name>YOUR_MUSIC_FILENAME</name>
          <volume>0.85</volume>
        </Ambience>
      </ambience>
      <screens>1</screens>
    </AmbienceSave>
   ```
2. Find the `sections` tag and paste the snippet right after it's opening tag on a new line.
3. Replace `YOUR_MUSIC_FILENAME` with the filename of your packed music file.
4. Change the value of the volume, if the music in-game it's too quiet or loud.
   > The minimum value for the volume is 0 and the maximum value is 1, but all the values in between works. The game is known to crash if the volume is higher than 1.
   {: .disclaimer }
5. Change the `screens` value to how many screens you want to have the music above.
   > The `<screens>` tag <u>doesnt work with the name logic of the screen number</u>. This is precisely made to avoid mixmatches.
    **From the first `<AmbienceSave>` it keeps the `<screens>` number counting.** So if you have two AmbienceSaves where the first one has screens with a value of 5 and the second has a value of 2, you would have done already 7 screens of music.

## Next up

You can finally add all the music you wanted to add on full-blast, let's take a final [look at particles]({{site.baseurl}}/level-making/particles) before publishing.

### Ambient
The ambient music should be placed inside `audio/background` as an .xnb file.<br>To add this to a specific zone, simply edit the `audio/background/data/values.xml` and add on the AmbienceSave section like so:
```xml 
<sections>
  <AmbienceSave>
    <ambience>
      <Ambience>
        <name>Water</name>
        <volume>0.7</volume>
      </Ambience>
      <!-- more Ambience -->
    </ambience>
  </AmbienceSave>
  <!-- more AmbienceSaves -->

  <screens>5</screens>
</sections>
```

### Music
The music should be placed inside `audio/background` as an .xnb file.<br>To add this to a specific zone, simply edit the `audio/background/data/values.xml` and add on the AmbienceSave section like so:

```xml
<sections>
  <AmbienceSave>
    <ambience>
      <Ambience>
        <name>TheBogTwo</name>
        <volume>0.85</volume>
      </Ambience>
      <!-- more Ambience -->
    </ambience>
  </AmbienceSave>
  <!-- more AmbienceSaves -->

  <screens>5</screens>
</sections>
```

In the `values.xml` file mentioned above, this needs to be configured as an `AmbienceInfo` as well.

```xml 
<special_info>
  <AmbienceInfo>
    <name>TheBogTwo</name>
    <type>Music</type>
    <restart>true</restart>
  </AmbienceInfo>
  <!-- more AmbienceInfo -->
</special_info>
```
