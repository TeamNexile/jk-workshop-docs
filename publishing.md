Long gone are the times of following all the steps taken by JumpKingPlus' verification and waiting for approval. Each item you upload is [publicly available*](#eula-agreement) in <strong>a matter of seconds</strong>!

## Two important disclaimers
> ### Steam's EULA Agreement
> https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoplegalagreement/
> enable eula to have it public

> ### Don't forget the guidelines!
> follow the damn rules

## Steps

1. Open the upload tool.<br>By default, the tool should prompt you to agree to the EULA agreement each start (if you didnt tick the eula already). [idea to do on tool].
2. On the Upload tab, click on Select folder...
3. Once selected the right folder, click OK.<br>If you get any errors, follow the prompt steps on your screen.<br>If it returns that the folder has been loaded, you'll be able to see what type of item you are about to upload by the label below the description.
4. Add a title and a description for your item, this will be used for your item, this can be later modified through Steam.
5. *(Optional)* Add a thumbnail to be more recognizable!<br>For the Steam limitations, we recommend you to follow the following details:
   - resolution: 256x256 pixels
   - bit depth: 8 bit
   - size: below 34 kB (kilobytes)
6. Click Upload and let the tool upload the item for you.


## Next steps
