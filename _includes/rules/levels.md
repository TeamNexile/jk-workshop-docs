1.  **Screen transitions must be full jumps**; it would be unfair for a player not knowing how to jump over a new screen.
2.  **Transition platforms should always work** (with a full jump) and they **must not be related to a specific position** in the platform before the transition to the new screen.
3.  **Platforms must be bordered with a line** (with at least 1px).
4.  Not more than **three** consecutives 1 pixel jumps (1px in the hitboxes file).
5.  The workshop encourages creators to make their maps **beatable with boots/snake ring** and/or **no fall** in mind. If the map doesn't follow such, it should be stated in the description.
