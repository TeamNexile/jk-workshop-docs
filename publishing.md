Long gone are the times of following all the steps taken by JumpKingPlus' verification and waiting for approval. Each item you upload is [publicly available*](#steams-eula-agreement) in <strong>a matter of seconds</strong>!

---

## Three important disclaimers

### Steam's EULA Agreement

Make sure you have accepted [Steam's EULA agreement](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoplegalagreement/){:target="_blank"}, if you haven't accepted it, your item won't be able to be seen by anyone but you.

### Don't forget the guidelines!

Just like JumpKingPlus had some *rules*, the Steam Workshop has **guidelines**. That means you don't have to strictly follow the rules to get your item published. That being said level design in Jump King is a delicate balance between fairness and hardness and <u>Nexile won't endorse levels that won't follow their guidelines</u>.

### Don't forget to playtest your level!

No one wants to play a **poor tested map** where **jumps don't work** or you get **stuck** for using slopes after **so much progress**, so please take your time to test it before releasing it. Publishing a poorly tested map <u>doesn't work in your favor</u> if you released a map earlier than necessary.

## Steps (using Worldsmith) [✳]

## Steps (using Workshop Manager)

{: .toc-spaced }
1. Open `Jump King Workshop Manager` from Steam or [**click here**](steam://rungameid/2245910).<br>
   
   ![Step 1](/images/publishing/Step1.png)
   
   {: .highlight }
   > If you can't find it, make sure you have tools enabled from the dropdown in your Steam library.
   ![Step 1a](/images/publishing/SteamToggleTools.png)
   
   ~~By default, the tool should prompt you to agree to the EULA agreement each start (if you didnt tick the eula already).~~{: .text-grey-dk-000 } (currently unavailable)

2. On the Upload tab, click on **Select folder...**
   ![Step 2](/images/publishing/Step2.png)

3. Once selected the right folder, click **OK**.
   ![Step 3](/images/publishing/Step3.png) 
   > If you get any errors, follow the prompt instructions on your screen. 
   {: .warning }
   > If it returns that the folder has been loaded, you'll be able to see what type of item you are about to upload by the label below the description.
   > ![Step 3a](/images/publishing/Step3a.png)
   {: .highlight }

4. Add a title and a description for your item, this will be used for your item, this can be later modified through Steam.<br>
   ![Step 4](/images/publishing/Step4.png)

5. *Optional*{: .text-grey-dk-000 } 
   —
   **Add a thumbnail to be more recognizable!**
  
   To add an image, click on the thumbnail blank image on the right, it will open up the file explorer where you will need to select your image.

   {: .warning }
   > For the Steam limitations, we recommend you to follow the following details:
   - resolution: **256x256 pixels**
   - file size: below **34 kB** (kilobytes)
   - bit depth: **8 bit** *(not required but lowers the file size dramatically)*
   - image type: **png** *(not requred but lowers the file size dramatically)*

   If your image follows the limitations above, it will change the thumbnail to the image you selected.
   ![Step 5](/images/publishing/Step5.png)

6. Click Upload and let the tool upload the item for you.
   ![Step 6](/images/publishing/Step6.png)


## Next steps
Once the upload is completed, it will ask you if you to see it on the Steam Workshop's page, from there you can further modify its page by adding more images, improve your description or decide to remove your item.
