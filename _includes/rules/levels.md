1.  **Screen transitions must be full jumps**; it would be unfair for a player not knowing how to jump over a new screen.
2.  **Transition platforms** (platforms from where you jump to the next screen) **should NOT be dependent on the player's position** on the platform itself.
3.  **Platforms must outlined with** an at least **1px** thick border (hidden walls and fake blocks should have distinguishable outlines).
4.  Not more than **three** consecutives 1 pixel jumps (1px in the hitboxes file).
5.  The workshop encourages creators to make their levels **beatable with boots/snake ring** and/or **no fall** in mind. If the level doesn't follow such, it should be stated in the description.
