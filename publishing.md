This process usually takes longer than reskins since the level has to go under inspection to verify it's quality.

1. Head over on the [__publish page__]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshop/publish).
2. Click on **Upload your level**.
3. Read carefully the rules and make sure you are following them.
4. Click on **I agree on the guidelines**.
5. Choose which form to open (if by having it in a new window or being inside the page) and compile it.
6. Done!

Relatively new feature. This process is pretty fast since it doesn't require big inspection.

1. Head over on the [__publish page__]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshop/publish).
2. Click on **Upload your reskin or collection**.
3. Read carefully the rules and make sure you are following them.
4. Click on **I agree on the guidelines**.
5. Choose which form to open (if by having it in a new window or being inside the page) and compile it.
6. Done!
