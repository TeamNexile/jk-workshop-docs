## Usage

1. Move the executable into the folder that contains your "level.png" or viceversa (just make sure the folder isn't the Desktop since the folder will generate a lot of files).
   ![Hitbox2Screens before]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/hitbox2screens_before.png)
2. Run the exectuable, this will generate all **169 screens as individual PNGs** to be used.
   ![Hitbox2Screens after]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tools/hitbox2screens_after.png)
3. Done!
