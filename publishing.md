## Three important disclaimers

### Steam's EULA Agreement

Make sure you have accepted [Steam's EULA agreement](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoplegalagreement/){:target="_blank"}, if you haven't accepted it, your item won't be available to be seen by anyone but you.

### Read Nexile's guidelines

<u>Nexile is unlikely to endorse levels that do not follow </u>[Nexile guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/guidelines/#nexiles-guidelines).

### Playtest your level

Make sure you have read the [**Testing**]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/map-first-steps/#testing) section of Level: First steps.

   - resolution: **256x256 pixels**
   - file size: below **34 kB** (kilobytes)
   - bit depth: **8 bit** *(not required but lowers the file size dramatically)*

   If your image follows the limitations above, it will change the thumbnail preview to the image you previously selected.
