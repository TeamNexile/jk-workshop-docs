# Tools overhaul
{: .fs-9 }

> Previously with JumpKingPlus, the tools used were community-made and pretty rudimental meaning the leaning curve for making content on Jump King became more steep because you also had to learn how to use the additional tools. This is about to change with Worldsmith, more details coming soon.
{: .new }

Without Worldsmith, every modification you do from hitboxes and textures to music or sound effects, needs to be compiled (or packed) in order for Jump King to be updated, in the following section called [**Content packing tools**](/tools/alternatives) we'll go over the pro and cons of these alternatives.

Below the Content packing tools section there are [**Level helping tools**](/tools/map-tools); these tools are not necessary but can enhance your productivity on creating a custom level.
